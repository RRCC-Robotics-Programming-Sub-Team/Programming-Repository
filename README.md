# Programming-Arduino-Repository

This is the RRCC Space Grant: Robotics Team Repository for Arduino code implemented on our robot in development. This will be an ongoing project to build up to a rover similar to the official NASA Mars Rover. We are funded through NASA and RRCC and our development is for the NASA Colorado Space Grant Contorsium Robotics Challenge. This code is meant to be edited by Red Rocks Community College Robotics over the ongoing years to develop our skills and develop the robot to be ever more complex.

The code works with ultrasonic sensors, ESC motor controls, and a PID controller with GM3506 Gimbal Motors with encoders.
There are separate files and folders for each script. All are with C++, C, or Arduino IDE language.
